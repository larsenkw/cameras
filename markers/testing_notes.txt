*Markers 4 and 8 do not give consistent readings compared to the others.
*Make sure the markers have big enough white borders so the code does not pick up the outer cardboard border as a square.

File Names ([d]_[h]_[theta]_[phi])
d = straightline distance from origin
h = height of lens
theta = straightline angle from origin (+ ccw, - cw)
phi = pitch of camera (+ up, - down)
