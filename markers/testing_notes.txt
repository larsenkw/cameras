*Markers 4 and 8 do not give consistent readings compared to the others.
*Make sure the markers have big enough white boarders so the code does not pick up the outer cardboard boarder as a square.

File Names ([d]_[h]_[theta]_[phi])
d = straightline distance from origin
h = height of lense
theta = straightline angle from origin (+ ccw, - cw)
phi = pitch of camera (+ up, - down)

Straight line, level
d = varies
h = 1.535
theta = 0
phi = 0

*Need to add 0.025m to each straight line distance
